    			Louis Daniel Armstrong (August 4,1901-July6,1971), aka <em>Satchmo</em>, was a widely known African-American trumpeter, who left his mark on the musical genre known as jazz. His career lasted for 50 years and in 2017 was inducted into the Rythm & Blues Hall of Fame. Although widely known for his trumpet playing, Armstrong, also had a distinct singing voice. His gravelly voice can be instantly recognized in the popular song "What A Wonderful World".

    			Armstrong was born in New Orleans to a 16 year old mother and a father who abandoned them shortly after. Louis' grandmother took to raising him until he reached the age of 6 years old. It was then that a Jewish family, the Karnoffskys, who he had worked for took him in and made him a part of their group. They gave him an advance and with that he bought his first instrument, a cornet, from a pawn shop.

    			Dropping out of school at only 11 years old, Armstrong, joined a quartet of boys who sang in the streets for money. He was arrested in December 31, 1912 for firing a blank into the air out of his stepfathers gun. Sentenced to a boys home; it was here where he would attain lessons from Peter Davis, a regular visitor. His main education came from playing in brass bands and riverboats in New Orleans. He traveled with the band Fate Marabl and it was with this band that he regards as "going to university". With this group he gained the experience working with written arrangements. As his skill began to grow he moved to Chicago where he could earn a higher wage.

    			During the 1920s, Louis Armstrong brought a huge impact during the Harlem Renaissance within the Jazz world. The music he created was an incredible part of his life during the Harlem Renaissance. His impact touched many, including a well known man during that time named Langston Hughes. The admiration he had for Armstrong and acknowledging him as one of the most recognized musicians during the era. Within Hughes writings, he created many books which held the central idea of jazz and recognition to Armstrong as one of the most important person to be part of the new found love of their culture. The sound of jazz, along with many other musicians such as Armstrong, helped shape Hughes as a writer. Just as the musicians, Hughes wrote his words with jazz.

    			Against his doctor's advice, Armstrong played a two-week engagement in March 1971 at the Waldorf-Astoria's Empire Room. At the end of it, he was hospitalized for a heart attack. He was released from the hospital in May, and quickly resumed practicing his trumpet playing. Still hoping to get back on the road, Armstrong died of a heart attack in his sleep on July 6, 1971, a month before his 70th birthday. He was residing in Corona, Queens, New York City, at the time of his death. He was interred in Flushing Cemetery, Flushing, in Queens, New York City. His honorary pallbearers included Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Pearl Bailey, Count Basie, Harry James, Frank Sinatra, Ed Sullivan, Earl Wilson, Alan King, Johnny Carson and David Frost. Peggy Lee sang The Lord's Prayer at the services while Al Hibbler sang "Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen" and Fred Robbins, a long-time friend, gave the eulogy.

    			The influence of Armstrong on the development of jazz is virtually immeasurable. His irrepressible personality both as a performer and as a public figure was so strong that to some it sometimes overshadowed his contributions as a musician and singer. As a virtuoso trumpet player, Armstrong had a unique tone and an extraordinary talent for melodic improvisation. Through his playing, the trumpet emerged as a solo instrument in jazz and is used widely today. Additionally, jazz itself was transformed from a collectively improvised folk music to a soloist's serious art form largely through his influence. He was a masterful accompanist and ensemble player in addition to his extraordinary skills as a soloist. With his innovations, he raised the bar musically for all who came after him.
